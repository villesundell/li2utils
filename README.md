There is a significant lack of simple FIPS 204 (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) signature generators/verifiers.
This simple toolset is written in Rust, and contains two tools: `li2sign` and `li2verify`.

**This is provided for your convenience, and contains no audit, assurance or fittness for any purpose whatsoever.**

This toolset relies completely on the great [`fips204`](https://crates.io/crates/fips204) Rust library by the RustCrypto Developers.
